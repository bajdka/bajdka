👋. Hi, I’m @bajdka aka Daria Bajda\
👀. I’m interested in Quality Assistance idea which I believe increases the power and possibilities of the product development teams.\
🌱. I’m currently learning Kotlin, Groovy, SpringBoot, JS/TS and Preact.\
💞️. I’m looking to collaborate on quality assurance related tools that support static analysis, different types of automated testing and simplifies manual testing.\
